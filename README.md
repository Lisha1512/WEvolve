**# WEvolve**

For the last 2 years, the covid paranoia has kept most of us in seclusion and fear. Everyone got used to an online and secluded way of living. However, with the lockdowns and restrictions being lifted, people have been thrown back into their workspaces and colleges. Many people are finding it difficult to mentally adjust to this sudden change after being secluded for so long. 
They have to travel to and fro, interact with so many people everyday, which has become tiring and stressful to many. This sudden change has been very overstimulating and people have not been able to relax peacefully. 

Our project - WEvolve is an online space built for people who need some time to relax and clear their head. With features like journaling, guided meditation and breathing timers, relaxing natural sounds and music, tips, blogs and helpline numbers, WEvolve aims to be a one stop solution for all your well being needs. Because as Anne Lamott once said, “Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes… including you”
